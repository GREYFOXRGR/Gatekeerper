Gatekeerper

A kernel extension to mitigate Gatekeeper bypasses

Doesn't let linked (frameworks, libraries, bundles) unsigned code run if main binary is signed

Untested with latest Gatekeeper bypass by Patrick Wardle (https://www.virusbtn.com/pdf/conference_slides/2015/Wardle-VB2015.pdf). 

I'm too lazy to create a PoC of that bypass. So I'm just guessing it will work but I'm pretty confident anyway :-)
